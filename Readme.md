**Enterprise Gaming Center Management & Match Monitoring System**

*"Built for the next generation of PlayStation Gaming Centers."*

</p>

---

# 🚀 Overview

ZoneEye is an enterprise-grade monitoring and management platform designed for PlayStation gaming centers.

The system automatically monitors FIFA matches, tracks playing time, detects match states, records gameplay evidence, communicates with a central server, and provides accurate billing information.

Unlike traditional timer applications, ZoneEye uses Computer Vision (OpenCV) and OCR (Tesseract) to understand what is happening on the game screen.
